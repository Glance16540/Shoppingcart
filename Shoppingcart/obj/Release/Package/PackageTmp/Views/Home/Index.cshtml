        <p >
            If you want to be academic about it, the watch is something of an engineering marvel. Watches have hundreds of minuscule parts, meticulously assembled by artisans who can trace their craft back to the watchmakers under Elizabeth, Peter, and Napoleon. Before the Great War, these artisans were focused on making pocket watches, a true gentleman’s accessory. But during the First World War, soldiers found that the small, easy to maintain wristwatches were an asset in the wet trenches. When the war ended, young well-dressed men wanted to emulate the gallant heroes of the war, and wristwatches became a must-have.

            Today, however, watches are often neglected, and with the proliferation of cell phones, considered  an outdated novelty to some.  But a good watch is so much more than a timepiece – it’s an accessory for all occasions, it’s a status symbol, it’s an investment, and if you choose to pass yours on, it’s a legacy. For those of you who want to take their timepieces a bit more seriously, here are five sure signs of a quality watch.......

                What a watch. It’s utterly beautiful.
                I wasn’t quite expecting to fall in love with it – on first sight – in the way that I have.
                The weight, the size, the feel of it. It has the feel of something that is a ‘classic’ – the delicate-yet-confident feel of something that’s been around for ever. Like a precious heirloom that I’ve just inherited. Everything feels so perfectly considered – but in an effortless way. I can’t stop glancing at my wrist, which has made reading the paper this morning (see pic) hard. It’s a masterpiece. Extraordinary achievement. I’m very proud to have a first edition Sekford watch.

                Dear Sirs,
                My girlfriend has taken my watch and i’d like to buy another one.
                Do you offer discounts on a second purchase?

                I have fallen in love with my watch completely and so has my wife. She was even wearing it around the house yesterday. It is a true object of beauty and I am thoroughly enjoying exploring all it’s discoverable wonders!

                The watches incorporate everything I would expect in an elegant watch. Beautiful craftsmanship, fantastic attention to detail, understated yet very distinct (the numerals are nothing short of a masterpiece) all that at a price point that doesn’t require you to remortgage your house. A truly fine dress watch.

                Hello,
                I received my watch from Aria this morning and I can’t believe how smart and elegant it is.
                Best wishes with your lovely company! I look forward to the newsletters.
